# Employee Tracker 

## Description 
This application was create so that an user can create tables to show their employees. The employees will all have ID's, their roles will be specified, which manager they're under will be specified, and their department will be specified. This application creates the table dynamically and quickly for the user. To use the application, the user must download the file onto their computer. Once they have the application downloaded, they can use the command line in order to edit their tables. They will be prompted with questions about what they would like to view or add, and then they can decide which they would like to do. This application uses MYSQL, inquirer, and console tables to allow the user to use the application. A walk through video of the application is linked below.
